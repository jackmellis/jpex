config
can pass in a config option when extending a class, the options are merged into the default options. If this class is extended, the config options will be picked up.

default lifecycle for factories and services can be configured

bindToInstance
can accept deeply nested value i.e. x.y.z will bind dependencies to instance.x.y.z

webpack
can be safely webpack-ified

internal variables renamed
many internal variables have been renamed, are all non-enumerable, and are prefixed with $$

factories
all default factories have been separated from the core module (except $resolve)

Singleton option removed from factories/services

Factory registration methods renamed to camelCase (Jpex.Register.Factory becomes Jpex.register.factory)

Interfaces completely removed

Factory types removed: enum, errorType, file, folder, interface, nodeModule

node_module factory type is included in jpex-node plugin

$resolve can be accessed directly on the class (Jpex.$resolve())

$resolve can be called with an array of dependencies to resolve

Cached factories can be cleared with $clearCache

Decorators can now be registered

Hooks
Can now hook into events throughout the class lifecycle:
extend
Class, options
options
options, merge(...obj)
beforeCreate
Class, options, instance, args
created
Class, options, instance, args
privateProperties
Class, options, apply(opt)
factories
Class, options, register(name, fn)
